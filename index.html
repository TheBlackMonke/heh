Beneath the starlit sky, our love's secret line
Like leaves, we soar so high
Beneath the moonlight, soft touch, your hand in mine
Gets me every time

Lost in the city lights, our love's electric, right?
You make me feel alive
I know July is gone, you make me feel at home
In the neon glow

As the leaves change color, I dive into you
When summer's fadin', there's nothin' to do, but
Bask in thе glory of the winter sun
Maybe this is thе season of love

Beneath an endless night, the world spins around
You're there, ease my mind
Like stars that never die, you and I, we shine
During the darkest times

As the leaves change color, I dive into you
When summer's fadin', there's nothin' to do, but
Bask in the glory of the winter sun
Maybe this is the season of love
As the leaves change color, I dive into you
When summer's fadin', there's nothin' to do, but
Bask in the glory of the winter sun
Maybe this is the season of love
